# Puddletown UI Bootstrap

UI development environment with webpack. Produces fully optimized dist directories.

## Getting started

Install project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

_I prefer `pnpm`. It's a lot more sane approach to `node_modules`_

Setting up a fresh git repo

```bash
npm run setup
```

To start the project

```bash
npm start
```

and navigate to:

<http://localhost:8080>

Edit the files in the `src` directory

To run tests on your javascript using mocha

```bash
npm test
```

To build the project final build for distribution

```bash
npm build
```

Enjoy the SASS and bundled javascript!
