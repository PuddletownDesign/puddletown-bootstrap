## Editing the CSS

SCSS is transpiled into CSS. Just edit the scss files.

They are structured as follows. Usually the 0000.scss is a good place to start. Just trash everything you don't want and build what you do.

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ _0000.scss # the default style sheet (mobile first) 
â”œâ”€â”€ _0480.scss # the style sheet that begins at the 480px width breakpoint
â”œâ”€â”€ _0760.scss # 760px width breakpoint
â”œâ”€â”€ _0980.scss # etc
â”œâ”€â”€ _1200.scss
â”œâ”€â”€ _1400.scss
â”œâ”€â”€ _1600.scss
â”œâ”€â”€ includes
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _colors.scss # all color info
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _fonts.scss # all font info
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _mixins.scss # all SASS mixin info
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _plugins.scss # just dump all plugin code here
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _reset.scss # keeps things clean in between browsers
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _responsive.scss # master routing for all the top level scss files
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ _typography.scss # includes with all typography info
â””â”€â”€ styles.scss # master scss routing file
```

## Editing the javascript

Javascript is bundled by webpack and babel is set for es5 - es7. Trash what you don't need and write exactly what and how you want.

## To run tests on your javascript using mocha

```bash
npm test
```

**Enjoy the SASS and bundled javascript!**
